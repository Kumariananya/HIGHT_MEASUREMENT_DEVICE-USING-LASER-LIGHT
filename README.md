# HIGHT_MEASUREMENT_DEVICE-USING-LASER-LIGHT
A laser height meter measures vertical distance by projecting a laser beam onto a target and detecting the reflection. The device calculates the height based on the time it takes for the laser to return to the sensor. It provides accurate, non-contact measurements, ideal for various applications.
